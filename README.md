# Student Credits System

This Python project is designed to track students' credits and determine their exam outcomes. Based on the students' credits, the program classifies their progress into four categories: Progress, Progress Trailer, Retriever, and Exclude. Additionally, the project generates a histogram displaying the count of each category using graphics.
